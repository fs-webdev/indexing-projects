title: US, Wyoming—WWI Draft Registration Cards, 1917–1918 (Part 4A)
---

## {{ page.title }}

<p class="intro">On May 18, 1917, Congress passed the Selective Service Act, authorizing President Woodrow Wilson to draft men into military service. The Selective Service System required all men, regardless of citizenship, between the ages of 18 and 45 to register for the draft. This requirement resulted in three separate registrations. Each registration used a slightly different variation of the registration card.</p>
